# m0d-s0beit-sa

mod_sa ( m0d s0beit sa ) is a Multi-purpose cheat tool for Grand Theft Auto San Andreas and San Andreas Multiplayer

The current developers are not planning on updating mod_sa to SA-MP v0.3e or later at this time. However the project is always open to qualified trustworthy developers, and we welcome your communication

Until this project is active again, we recommend checking out [this other project over here](https://github.com/BlastHackNet/mod_s0beit_sa/).

Users: Please DO NOT continue to email us about updates for SA-MP right now. It's annoying and accomplishes nothing. If you must discuss it, please use our Google group (not the source group) and please use one of the existing threads about it. Try to contribute something instead of simply begging, and we'll be less inclined to ignore it.

p.s. we don't have an official Facebook page, so the one that's up there isn't us.
